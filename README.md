# [Slice of Ice](https://clang27.itch.io/slice-of-ice)

Oh, no! The ice has broken, and a penguin is stuck on top of a chunk of ice. Stay on top of the ice block for as long as possible and achieve the highest score!

## Controls

WASD or ← ↑ → ↓:  Move Penguin

## Background

This was created for Major Jam 3 and follows the one limitation: 96x96 resolution. 

The ice block is 80x80, and there is a 16-pixel transparent effect along the edges of the window. The transparent background makes the penguin look like he is actually falling off the edge of the ice block. Enjoy and have fun! Thank you so much for playing!
